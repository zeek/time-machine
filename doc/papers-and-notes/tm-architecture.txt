Multithreaded Timemachine Architecture

slightlt out of date. General idea and number of threads
are still acurate though.


OVERVIEW

The TM consists of the following "components" 

- Packet Capture and Fifo Management. This is one thread
- Indexing System (serveral threads). One thread for every index.
	One index aggregation thread, responsible for maintaining and 
	aggregating the index files on harddisk. 
- Local console interface (one thread)
- Remote console interface (tcp client/server). One thread
	controlling the listen socket. One thread for every incoming
	connection.
- StatisticsLog. Writes tm.log file. One thread
- broccoli. Number of threads unknown to me. Prbably just one. 


The following threads are persistent and are started directly from main()
I.e. these threads are started when the 
TM starts and they keep running until the TM is shut down. Note that
some of these thread can be deactivated in the config file (i.e. if one
disabled the local console interface). 

- a Storage object is created (and stored in the global variable Storage). 
The constructor of Storage spawns the capture thread. Furthemore
the constructor of Storage spwans a thread for each configured index. 
- index_aggregation_thread
- server_listen_thread (for remote console interface)
- cli_console_thread (for local console)
- broccoli_thread
- statisticslog_thread
- main thread. This thread does nothing an just waits for cli_console_thread
to finish (pthread_join). This should probably be changed. 


More, non-persistent, threads are spwaned from server_listen_thread and proably
from broccoli_thread too.

The central point of the TM is an instance of the Storage class. This instance
spwans the capture thread, keeps the connection table, the fifo, spwans the
index threads etc. Theoreticly more than one Storage can be instanciated and
used but some parts of the TM still depend on the global storage object. 



PACKET CAPTURE AND FIFO MANAGEMENT. 

Packet capture and fifo management is done from the Storage class. 

For each configured class a Fifo is created. The Fifo object itself capsulates
a FifoMem and a FifoDisk instance and moves packets from FifoMem to
FifoDisk if necessary. Storage keeps track about these fifos in a std::list.

For each configured index, storage creates the appropriate Index<T> 
class and starts an index maintainer thread for this index. Furthermore
the index is added to the indexes member, which keeps track of all
configured indexes. This index book keeping is done through the 
Indexes class (declared in Index.hh)

The packet capture and fifo management is done in one thread. The capture
thread runs pcap_loop and uses callback() as dispatcher function for
pcap_loop.  callback() just calls storage->addPkt() with the header and 
packet data.  pcap_loop uses the global storage variable!

addPkt() updates the connection table and checks if this connections is 
subscribed. If the connection is already known in the connection table, the
approriate fifo is returned by the connection table. If the connection resp.
its fifo is unknown, all fifos (all configured classes) are checked until
a matching fifo with the highest precedence is found. 
The appropriate Fifo::addPkt() function is called with the packet. Here
the cutoff is done (if necessary).
If the packet was successfully added (i.e. if it wasn't cutoff), the
packet is added to every configured index. 
If the connection has been subscribed, the appropriate QueryRequest 
object has been aquired from the connection table and the packet is
send down the QueryRequest channel. Using QueryRequest::sendPkt(). 
QueryRequests are discussed later. 




INDEXING SYSTEM

The goal is to index the stored packets. Keys for indexing can be any
fields from the packet header. All indexes / connection are considered 
bi-directional. That is: The two directions of a connection are not 
distinguished.
To actually locate the indexed packets, we store time intervals in the
Index data structures. That is if e.g. a connection was active
between t1 and t2. Then had a long period of inactivity then was active
again from t3 to t4, then the index would store the intervals [t1,t2] 
and [t3,t4]. The "inactivity period" is, of course, configurable and 
will depend on the expected inter-arrival-time of packets on the link


INDEX DATA TYPES

Every Index is stored through the templated Index<T> class. T is a class
derived from IndexField. The Index class keeps the most recent part of
the index in main memory. After some time the entries from memory
are swapped to disk. The IndexClass has a member disk_index 
(and IndexFile<T> instance) that takes care of the files on disk. 

IndexField:
Examples for IndexFields are ConnectionIF4, ConnectionIF3, SrcPort, etc. 
If you want to index packets according to the connection tupel
(proto, ip, port, ip, port), then you must instanciate a Index<ConnectionIF4>
class. An IndexField class has two meaningings: 
* An instance of an IndexField class is used to represent a key for an index
entry (e.g. a ConnectionIF4 instance can store: tcp 1.2.4.5:6 -> 7.8.9.10:11
* The class itself is used to describe the index (getIndexNameStatic()) 
and to generate instances of the appropriate IndexField class throug genKeys()


Some properties/methods of IndexField derivates
	- getIndexName(), getIndexNameStatic():
	returns a (unique) name for this Index. This index name
	is hardcoded in the appropriate class definition. It is used to as part
	of the filename of the index files, for quering a specific index. In the
	future it is planned to dynamicly add/delete index during runtime. For this
	the index name would be used too. 
	- getConstKeyPtr(). Returns a (void *) to the key stored in this class. For
	ConnectionIF4 this would be a pointer to a mem location containing (proto,
	ip, port, ip, port) in some packed form. Different keys can be compared using
	memcmp. 
	- getKeySize(). Returns the length of the mem area returned by getConstKeyPtr()
	- hash(). Returns a hash value for the stored key.
	- static genKeys(). Returns a list of pointers to instances of the IndexField 
	class. The genKeys() is passed a pointer to the packet data. It then extracts
	the appropriate fields, creates the appropriate number of IndexField derivate
	class instances and returns them. Since the direction of a connection is 
	not used, the fields are ordered, so that a packet from 1.2.3.4:55 -> 7.8.9.10:11
	has the same key (as defined by getConstKeyPtr()) as 7.8.9.10:11->1.2.3.4:55.
	Why do we need to return a list of class pointers? Consider the case of an
	index of Ip-Adresses. We need both, the src and the dst IP, so genKeys() must
	return two pointers. Another example: ConnectionIF3 uses a 3-tupel 
	(ip, ip, port). But again, since we don't care about the direction we
	must generate two keys per packet (ip, ip, srcport) and (ip, ip, dstport).
	And again, the IPs must be order to be direction independent.
	- static parseQuery(). This function is used from the Query subsystem. 
	It is passed a string representation of the appropriate key (e.g.
	for ConnectionIF4 the representation is "proto ip:port ip:port:. This
	string is parsed (normally using regular expressions), an appropriate
	IndexField class is generated and returned. This IndexField class
	can then be compared to the entries stored in the various Indexes 
	(to be precise: the getConstKeyPtr() can be memcmp'ed)


Index<T> manages the index entries in memory. 
Index uses double buffered hashtables (cur, old) to store the entries. New entries
are added to the cur hashtable. Whenever the oldest entry in cur is older than
the oldest entry in the memory fifos, then the old hash is cleared an the hashes
are swapped. This means that every packet in the memory fifo is indexed by entries
in the memory. It is ensured that no index entry for a packet in main memory is
already on disk. We can also conclude that just before rotation, the index in 
memory spans about twice the time than the timespan of stored packets in FifoMem.
Just after the rotation, the memory index spans the timespan of the stored 
packets in FifoMem.
When the hashes are rotated the old one is written to disk (in fact
writing the index is only done on every second rotation). Upon the 
rotation the size of the hashtable is checked an, if needed it is
adjusted (the size is doubled or halfed)

There is also an IndexType abstract class. Its sole purpose is to
define a common Interface for all Index<Ts>

The key for the Index hashtables are IndexField*. The values or entries
are IndexEntry*. I.e. the cur and old hash of Index<T> are defined
is Hash<IndexField*, IndexEntry*>.
An IndexEntry stores a vector of (time-)intervals and the key of the
entry.


IntervalSet is a collection of Intverals needed for the query subsystem. 
Whenever a query is performed, the indexes are searched an the matching
intervals are returned as an IntervalSet object. Why don't we use 
IndexEntry for queries? Answer: A query can result in several IndexQuery
objects (up to one from cur, up to one from old, several from the index 
files). The IntervalSet ensures, that its Intervals are sorted in ascending
order and it also ensures that intervals don't overlap. 


Disk Index / IndexFiles<T>
The index  threads write in regular intervals (on every second rotate)
the indes entries to a file. This file is sorted, to enable fast disk lookups
using bianary search. A lookup on disk requires to search every file. 
Since the entries in the hashed are not sorted, we must sort them somehow
before we can write them to disk. We do this by adding them to a priority
queue and then writing the priority queue to disk.

Since we have to search every file and since the files are rather small, we
want to aggregate / merge several of these smaller files into larger
files. It's possible to repeat this multiple times to get an aggregation
hierachy with several aggregation levels. When a file is written to disk, it
is of aggregation level 0. Several of these level 0 files (say 10) are then
aggregated into one file of level 1, agein several level 1 files can be aggregated
into one level 2 file. 

The aggregation thread is responsible to for this aggregation of files. The 
file_number[level] and file_number_oldest[level] arrays are used to keep track of the
current files of a given level on disk. file_number_oldest is the oldest file (the
one with the lowest number) on disk. file_number is the next file number that is 
not yet written. 



INDEX THREAD MODEL

In indexing a lot of different threads "collide" 

The CaptureThread will call the addPkt() method. The addPkt() method
will convert the pcap-header and packet data into one ore more 
IndexField classes, enqueue these IndexField instances (using 
IndexQueueEntry classes and the input_q member) for further processing
and signal the thread maintaining this index, that new data has arrived.
The work of the CaptureThread is then finished. 

For each Index an index maintainer thread is reponsible for maintaining
the index.  The implementation of this thread is the run() method. 
The Index mnt. hread sleeps until it get's signaled that IndexField(s) have
been queued by the CaptureThread. It will then remove the IndexFields from
the queue, and store them in the internal hash (using addEntry())and it 
will also do hash maintance (roatating hashes, filling the priority queue, 
writing the priority queue to disk). 

The indexAggregationThread is a global thread, that is woken
up every couple of seconds. This thread will call the aggregate()
methods of all threads. 

The index maintaining thread calls IndexFiles<T>::writeIndex() to create a new index file
The aggregation thread calls IndexFiles<T>::aggregate() to aggregate/merge files together.
Query threads call lookup to search for entries on disk. 

Various QueryThreads may be running. These may call lookupMem() and 
lookupDisk(). 


NOTE: The input_q is used to communicate between the capture thread and
the index maintainer threads. Since the capture thread is time critical
the goal is to make the time in which the intput_q lock is held by the
maintainer thread as short as possible. This is done. 
But: there may be significant waiting times within the maintainer thread,
since the maintainer thread may be required to wait for the aggregation 
thread or for queries to finish. 


Index.hh and DiskIndex.hh have excessive comments concerning the locking
and signaling mechanisms between the various threads. 




LOCAL AND REMOTE CONSOLE / QUERIES

Besides the locale console on the controlling terminal, TM also features 
a remote console over a tcp network connection. The command language 
on both consoles is the same. The cmd_parser is used to parse and 
execute commands. Since the parser is not reentrant (and documentation 
on how to make the parser and scanner reentrant s**ks like hell) we protect
the actual parser with locks. The locks are automaticly checked and
aquired when parse_cmd() is called. 

Queries are also made from one of the consoles. The query specification
contains the index to search and the specification of the desired "key".
The index to search is the name returned by the IndexField::getIndexName()
method. The key is a string. This string is parsed with the 
IndexField::parseQuery() function. The Indexes class (the class keeping
all the configured indexes for storage) maps index names to Index<T> class
instances. 


The command language is briefly described in HOWTO
